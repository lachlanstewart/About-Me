### Primum Ad Sidera 

I grew up with my chin to the clouds, often questioning what the Moon's surface might feel like, and including stars in the background of my creations in art class. (To the dismay of my teacher!)
Turning this passion into my career, I'm in the second year of my Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. 

### College design teams 

While my freshman year was entirely online, I managed to joined the university cubesat team and gained great experience integrating the imaging system to the central onboard computer. Once I got on campus in-person, I joined the college rocketry team (SARP) and have since been working on my first **real** rocket. (-- Mention Uvic rocketry) 

### Victoria to Seattle 

Fromt the age of 13, I caddied regularly at the Victoria Golf Club.
This, along with good grades and community volunteerwork, helped me earn the Chick Evans Scholarship - a full ride American scholarship.
